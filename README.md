# Introduction-to-machine-learning
Some of the basic concepts related to machine learning are demonstrated using codes.

The codes are of the following concepts:
1. Linear regression code for predicting boston house price data. This code may contain some error.
2. Normal equation, which is substitute of gradient deiscent for some case senario is used for predicting boston house price prediction.
3. ANN is used for testing purpose for using it as some of the logical gates.
4. ANN is used for predicting the type of flower in IRIS dataset of flowers.
5. SVM is used for predicting the type of flower in IRIS dataset of flowers.
6. Decision tree is used for predicting the type of flower in IRIS dataset of flowers.
7. Naive Bayes is used for predicting the type of flower in IRIS dataset of flowers.
8. Bernouli Naive Bayes is used for predicting the type of flower in IRIS dataset of flowers.
